                <div class="accordion-body">An Intellectual Property clause
                    This clause is a provision where you, the business owner or inventor, retains ownership of your patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade dresses, or trade secrets.
                    <br>
                    Intellectual property security is crucial to promoting innovation.
                    <br>
                    Without the protection of ideas, individuals and businesses would not gain the full benefits of their creativity and would concentrate less on research and development.
                    <br>
                    Here's an example of Amazon's Intellectual Property Policy for sellers on its platform:
                    <br>
                    Amazon Intellectual Property Policy for Sellers - Intro section
                    <br>
                    This excerpt from Amazon sets out what sellers must do, and what they must not do when it comes to IP rights. It also adds some definitions and extra information for clarity, which is helpful to the readers.
                    <br>
                    A Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability clause
                    This type of clause is a contractual stipulation or disclaimer for an agreement that defines the circumstances under which you (the disclaiming party) could be held responsible for damages or loss.
                    <br>
                    It further sets the boundaries of damages that may be claimed in certain situations. This clause limits the amount payable as well as the exposure a company faces if a lawsuit is filed or another claim is made.
                    <br>
                    If deemed admissible, a Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability clause can "cover" the number of possible losses to which a business is exposed.
                    <br>
                    For example, a mobile app user experiences loss because they relied on information provided on that app. A Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability clause in the app's Terms and Conditions agreement could restrict the liability of the app owner, and by extension, limit the recoverable amount of the user.</div>
